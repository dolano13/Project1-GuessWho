# Project1-GuessWho
A play on the board game Guess Who, with Game of Thrones Trivia. 

Use the buttons at the bottom of the page to ask your question. Each button represents a different question you are asking.  If characters with the attribute you chose stay on the board, that means the chosen character has that attribute, if they disappear, the chosen character does not have that attribute.

For example: if you select “House Stark” and characters disappear the heir to the iron throne is NOT in House Stark. If you should choose “House Stark” And they remain, the heir IS in House Stark.

Think wisely as you choose your questions and analyze what characters are left. After you run out of battles (3 questions total) you will be able to click on the character you believe will end up on the throne.
